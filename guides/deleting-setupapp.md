# Deleting Setup.app

## Overview

Deleting Setup.app is an universal method to bypass activation on 32-bit iOS devices in case a specific device and iOS version combination is not supported by any other tool.

::: warning
It is strongly recommended to use any other method for bypassing activation, as deleting setup.app will break:
- iTunes syncing
- Siri
- Notifications
- and possibly iCloud sign-in.

::: info
Entering pwnDFU mode on A5(X) devices WILL require the use of <a href="pwning-with-checkm8-a5">checkm8-a5</a>, which require the use of a Raspberry Pi Pico or an Arduino with a USB host shield.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Ramdisk creation

Click one of the tools below to reveal the matching ramdisk creation instructions.


::: details **Legacy-iOS-Kit** Instructions

- Follow on-screen instructions to create and boot an SSH ramdisk.

**Info:** You can find your iOS version by using [iDescriptor](https://github.com/iDescriptor/iDescriptor) (all platforms) or [Legacy-iOS-Kit](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit) (Linux/macOS)

- Once the device has booted the SSH ramdisk, select `Connect to SSH` in the terminal window.

- Finally, run `mount.sh` to mount the filesystems.

::: details **SSHRD_Script** Instructions

- Clone the SSHRD_Script repository and enter it using the terminal: `git clone https://github.com/verygenericname/SSHRD_Script --recursive && cd SSHRD_Script`.

- Run `./sshrd.sh [iOS version for ramdisk]`.

**Info:** You can find your iOS version by using [iDescriptor](https://github.com/iDescriptor/iDescriptor) (all platforms) or [Legacy-iOS-Kit](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit) (Linux/macOS)

- Run `./sshrd.sh boot` to boot the ramdisk.

- Run `./sshrd.sh ssh` to connect to SSH on your device.
